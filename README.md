# Dynamic_Query
This is a query that I have been working on that the supervisor over the BI team wanted done.

They wanted a query that would dynamically pull the columns and data from an old table and insert it into a new table and they wanted it done dynamically.

## I have changed any table names and database names to protect the privacy of my company I work for.
